I finally came around to switch from `bash` to `zsh`.  While reading [hacker news] [1]
I found a nice little setup on *github*: [oh-my-zsh] [2]

Installation
------------

Installation was quite easy:

	$ brew install zsh
	$ cd $HOME
	$ git clone https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git .oh-my-zsh
	$ sudo chsh zsh

Configuration
-------------

TBD
