This is my **personal** blog -- I'll try to do regular posts which revolve around
the stuff I'm interested in.



### WTF?

{% pullquote %}
I'm a professional software developer.  I'm the founder of [nexiles] [1],
a software development and consulting software.
{"TL;DR: I'm a jack of all trades, journeyman of some.  "}
{% endpullquote %}

I've been programming computers basically my whole life -- I've started on a
[VIC 20] [2], moved to a [C64] [3], an [Amiga 500] [4], an [Amiga 2000] [5],
then to PCs.

Quickly after I started to study *applied computer science* I started to use
Linux.  I did a my diploma thesis at a company near Frankfurt, Germany.  They
created software which processed bank transaction data.  This software was run
on very big UNIX machines.  I was introduced to the `vi` editor (**not** the
*vim*) and terminals.  I've never been able to use a non-modal editor
efficiently.

My first job as professional software developer involved creating add-ons for a
[3D CAD] [7] system, which we coded in [C] [6].  These add-ons had to run on
all platforms the cad software was available back then: [Solaris] [8], [HP UX]
[9], [AIX] [10], [Linux] [11], [SGI/Irix] [12] and [Windows/NT] [13].  We had
**one** code base -- enough said.

Afterwards I got involved in Linux kernel development on the [ARM] [14]
architecture -- first using the [StrongARM] [15] SOC, then moving to the
[XScale] [16].  I did the whole stuff, board bring-up, hardware debugging using
a logic analyzer (involving lots of shouting, cursing, head banging), creating
a board support page, maintaining kernel deployments, creating custom drivers
for a custom high-speed measurement hardware, creating "userland" development
libraries for them.
created hard real-time drivers and software using [xenomai] [18], and I ported a
soft-SPS software to this platform.  I also helped to port over code which was written
for a older architecture with a fixed, static memory layout to this platform
(horrors!).  This was a very fun time, indeed.

In the mean time, I was a co-founder of [InQuant] [19], which I and all but
one of the founders left again afterwards to found [nexiles] [1].

During the time at *InQuant* -- sic, fancy spelling -- I've switched to
do full-time web development revolving around the [Zope] [20] and [Plone] [21]
systems.  This was when I got fond of [Python] [22].  Amongst other things,
back then we're hosted and developed the back end which drove the whole bunch
of artist pages over at Warner Music, Germany.  This was also the time when I got
introduced and fond of Test Driven Development.
Afterwards I got involved in Linux kernel development on the [ARM] [14]

{% pullquote %}
Nowadays I still develop using those fancy *higher* languages, and I got into
[coffeescript] [23] and we're doing UI development using [backbone.js] [24] in
the *enterprise* world.
{" enterprise mostly means obsolete browsers, obsolete mindsets, obsolete operanting systems and obsolete web stacks "}

I've come to a full circle now -- I'm doing back-end add-ons for a [PLM System] [25]
which is used to manage CAD data created by the CAD system.  But I've not forgot
where I come from -- I'm using [Jython] [26] to overcome some of the Java/Tomcat/Apache/Oracle
madness, and I'm developing my own, sane, lean JSON web API for the thing.
